use testfinscm;



select plans from budget plans where hiearchy path contains "region","country","function","costcenter";

now you have a list of plans ;
which means a list of plan_ids;

select plan_items from plan_line_item where in_plan in (set of plan_ids)

now you have a list of plan_items;

if you group the items by merchandise_code;
and sum(budget_amount)

now you have a list of

(merchandiseCode, totalBudgetAmt)
merchandiseCodes

select m.hiearchy_path from merchandise m where m.code in (merchandise_codes)
and you have your input for
category, sub1, sub2.

if there is no input for categories,
return the list of (merchandiseCode, totalBudgetAmt)

otherwise, select m.hiearchy_path that contains (category, sub1, sub2)
